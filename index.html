    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hello Everyone , My name is <em>Sonali Bedge</em>. I like to code.
        <br> After taking a break from my career to focus on family responsibilities, I am eager to return to the workforce and contribute to the development of cutting-edge software solutions. <br>
         During my break, I have stayed up-to-date with industry developments and have honed my skills through online courses and personal projects.<br>
        In my previous role as a <strong>software developer</strong> at Dots Info Systems(India), I developed expertise in several programming languages and frameworks, and successfully designed and implemented several software solutions that resulted in increased efficiency and productivity.<br> 
        I am highly analytical, able to solve complex problems, hardworking and have a proven track record of delivering high-quality software solutions.  </p>
