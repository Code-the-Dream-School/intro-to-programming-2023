        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a 21-year-old aspiring Software Engineer. After speaking with a close family member who was studying cyber security, I was inspired to investigate the tech world more for myself. From there I discovered some amazing fellow programmers on YouTube who helped solidify my choice in changing my career path. While developing strong communication skills within a team environment, I made a concerted effort to pursue my
dream through coding and tech webinars while challenging myself to build difficult projects.</p>
