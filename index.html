About
    I am currently a student at Code the Dream where beginning programmers are taught skills to build apps. Concurrently, I work at Amazon as a Problem Solver in the stow area. Previously, I was a Sales Associate in the jewelry, shoe, apparel, and accessory departments at Walmart. While working for Walmart, I earned a Web Design and Application Certificate through Wilmington University in Delaware. For fun, I enjoy spending my free time with family and friends.
