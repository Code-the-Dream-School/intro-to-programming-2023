        <h2>Passionate Data Professional | Tech Enthusiast | Agile Problem Solver</h2>
           
            Hello there! I'm Oluwadunsin Ogunleye, a dynamic data professional with a rich background <br>
            in database administration, business analysis, and full-stack development. My journey began<br>
            in Agricultural and Resource Economics, where I earned my Master's degree, and it has evolved<br>
            into a diverse skill set that spans SQL, Oracle technologies, Python, and more.
           
            In my current role as a Backend Developer at Tech Fleet, I've been instrumental in configuring,<br>
            troubleshooting, and maintaining complex database systems. Beyond technical prowess, I've honed my skills<br>
            in strategic planning, budgeting, and translating intricate analytics into actionable business solutions <br>
            during my tenure at Cheth Limited and Marvelous Computers.
           
            My commitment to continuous learning is evident in my certifications, including the Oracle Certified Associate,<br>
            and recent participation in Udacity's Full Stack Developer program. I am adept at working in fast-paced environments,<br>
            tackling challenges independently, and fostering collaboration within cross-functional teams.<br>
           
            Explore my portfolio to see how I've combined technical expertise with creative problem-solving, such as designing<br>
            and developing an adventure game with Python and crafting innovative solutions as a Data/Business Analyst. I'm excited<br>
            about the intersection of technology and business, and I look forward to bringing my passion and skills to your team.
           
            Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities at the nexus of data, technology, and innovation!
