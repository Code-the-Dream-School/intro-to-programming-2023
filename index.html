About

- Originally from California and raised in North Carolina, I am an aspiring software developer. Having spent the last few years working in Business Operations and immigration, I am excited to transition into the tech space. I enjoy yoga, reading nonfiction, writing, and spending time with family and friends. When I'm not coding, I am spending time with my partner and our two silly dogs.
