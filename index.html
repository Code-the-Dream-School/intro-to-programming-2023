About
 I just got to know about Code The Dream Program early this year, so I really started this program from scratch.
 even though coding is something new for me, I have been exposed to a thingking style and a growth
 mindset that a programmer has. I really interested in design, building a system, and really enjoy
 to learn a new things. There was a turning point moment in my life that made me that coding was what I wanted to do for my life.
